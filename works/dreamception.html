                have shown that it is interesting to use optical
                illusions in the video games, little is known about how to make the next games with illusions.
                Therefore, we propose a workflow and provide an illusion database and 6 specific illusion
                editors to help game designers without illusion expertise to build the illusion games.

        </div>
        <p class="project-content-text">
            This is our workflow. It consists of 5 steps: (1) choosing an object, (2): searching for an illusion with
            our database, (3): selecting a mechanic, (4): integrating the illusion into the game, (5): and optional
            revealing the illusion.

        <div class="project-image" style="background-image:url(../img/NS-sahft.gif); padding-bottom:50%">
        </div>
        <p class="project-step-title">Step 1: Choosing an object</p>

        <p class="project-content-text">
            To apply illusions, we have to choose an object from the game.There are many objects to choose from, such as
            the platforms, the character, the remaining life, and so on. Different objects result in different candidate
            illusions later. Here, let’s choose the platform.
        </p>
        <div class="project-image" style="background-image:url(../img/choose_object.png); padding-bottom:50%">
        </div>
        <p class="project-step-title">Step 2: Searching for an illusion with database</p>
        <p class="project-content-text">
            We look for matching illusions from our illusion database based on the object. Our database contains 163
            illusions in total.
        </p>
        <p class="project-content-text">
            Here is the link of our database: <a target="_blank"
                href="http://hci.csie.ntu.edu.tw/illusiondb">http://hci.csie.ntu.edu.tw/illusiondb</a>
        </p>
        <div class="project-image" style="background-image:url(../img/illusion_db.png); padding-bottom:34%"></div>
        <p class="project-content-text">
            Our database provides two meta-level tags: visual elements and effects. By selecting these tags, we can find
            corresponding illusions. The visual element tags describe what the game object looks like, while the effect
            tags describe what kind of effect the user wants to achieve.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="project-content-text">In this example, we search related illusions from visual elements. Let’s observe
            the standing platform. It is rectangle, and parallel to each other, so how about we choose the tags
            rectangle and parallel.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="project-content-text">Our database then returns a list of related illusions. Each contains a short
            animation and its name. We can click the illusion for more info such as a short description and related
            tags. In this example, we pick the Zollner Illusion. The Zollner Illusion makes parallel lines seem askew.
        </p>
        <div class="project-image" style="background-image:url(../img/zollner_illusion.png); padding-bottom:39%"></div>
        <p class="project-step-title">Step 3: Selecting a mechanic</p>
        <p class="project-content-text">After picking the illusion, now we have to think about how to apply the illusion
            to our game. We propose 2 illusion mechanics to think about, Misleading and Swapping realities.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="project-content-text italic">Misleading</p>
        <br />
        <p class="project-content-text">Misleading increases the game’s difficulty. To mislead players, we put both
            objects with and without illusions into the game. In this example, since the Zollner illusion makes the
            platforms seem tilted, we can put both the illusionized platforms and the real tilted platforms into the
            game. Now players are hard to distinguish whether the platforms are indeed tilted or not.</p>
        <div class="project-image"
            style="background-image:url(../img/misleading.gif); padding-bottom:50%; width: 28%; margin-left: 36%; margin-right: 36%;background-size: cover;">
        </div>
        <br />
        <p class="project-content-text italic">Swapping Reality</p>
        <br />
        <p class="project-content-text">
            On the other hand, Swapping realities creates different gameplay. To swap realities, players
            need to turn illusions into the reality of their games. In this example, we disable the player’s
            movement and allow players to add stripes to the platforms to make the platform look tilted,
            making the character slide from the platform to reach the goal. By doing this, illusion
            becomes reality.
        </p>
        <div class="project-image"
            style="background-image:url(../img/swap_reality1.gif); padding-bottom:50%; width: 28%; margin-left: 36%; margin-right: 36%;background-size: cover;">
        </div>
        <p class="project-content-text">Also, this can be done in a reversed way. Players remove the stripes by
            themselves to bring the reality back.</p>
        <div class="project-image"
            style="background-image:url(../img/swap_reality2.gif); padding-bottom:50%; width: 28%; margin-left: 36%; margin-right: 36%;background-size: cover;">
        </div>
        <p class="project-content-text">These two mechanics lead to different designs of illusion games. In this
            example, we take the misleading one.</p>
        <p class="project-step-title">Step 4: Integrating the illusion into the game</p>
        <p class="project-content-text">Before this step, we have a game design with illusion. Now we have to implement
            it.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="project-content-text">To help game designers, we provide 6 specific illusion editors for rapid
            prototyping.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="project-content-text">Our illusion editors integrate prior knowledge about illusions and help
            developers to apply illusions to their game objects.</p>
        <div class="project-image" style="background-image:url(../img/editors_Moment.jpg); padding-bottom:39%"></div>
        <p class="project-content-text">
            <span>Illusion editors: </span><a target="_blank"
                href="https://github.com/PoYaoCosmosWang/Game-Illusionization">https://github.com/PoYaoCosmosWang/Game-Illusionization</a>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="project-content-text">To use our illusion editors, just simply download and import our Unity Package
            from the link above, and then assign the game object to add illusion. For more details, please refer to
            readme in each illusion editor.</p>
        <p class="project-step-title">Step 5: optional revealing the illusion</p>
        <p class="project-content-text">
            Lastly, we have suggestions for designers to reveal illusions. Revealing explicitly makes
            players realize that there are illusions, rather than just glitches or bugs. However, some
            designers do not reveal illusions because they want to use illusions as Easter eggs for
            players to find out. So, we leave this step optional in our workflow.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="project-content-text">
            There are three ways to reveal: Adding an indicator, changing perspective, and removing the
            interference. We have more details about these in our paper. In this example, let’s choose
            removing the interference.
        </p>
        <div class="project-image"
            style="background-image:url(../img/removing_interference.gif); padding-bottom:50%; width: 28%; margin-left: 36%; margin-right: 36%;background-size: cover;">
        </div>
        <p class="project-content-text">By removing the interference from the platforms, we can see if the platforms are
            really tilted or not.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p class="project-content-text">After our workflow, the classic mini game has been illusionized to puzzle
            players and increase its difficulty.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="project-content-text">
            In this project, we also presented (1) other illusion game examples, (2) illusion game
            evaluation to have a preliminary understanding of illusion games, (3) workflow evaluation to
            understand how our workflow helps game designers, and (4) in-depth interview to know how
            the remaining workflow, especially our illusion editors, facilitates the implementation of
            illusion games.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="project-content-text">
            In conclusion, we propose a workflow to integrate optical illusions into video games.We
            provide an illusion database and 6 illusion editors.With our work, we hope more game
            designers without illusion expertise to join us to create more illusion games.
